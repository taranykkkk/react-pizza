React Pizza ---------------------------------------

!!!! If you do not receive the pizza list, please use a VPN (I did not know that this server is not available when using the Internet from a mobile operator) !!!!

This is a pizza store. It has pagination, category filtering, and sorting by price, popularity, and name.
To implement the backend, I used my server (I wrote all the data myself, in fact, this is a JSON file).

This is my second project on the React library.
Using the library:

- Redux ToolKit
- React Router
- React Skeleton
- QS (for generating query strings)
- AXIOS

I translated this project to TypeScript.
I used Webpack to build it.

To run the project, write in the terminal:

- npm run start

After that, your browser will open a page at http://localhost/3000/react-pizza

Thank you for your attention
